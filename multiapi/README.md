Multi-API Example Extension
============================

###### Demonstrates using both the Montoya API and the legacy Extender API in one extension

 ---

This extension works as follows:
- `registerExtenderCallbacks()` is called
    - It registers an extension name
    - It also includes `http://test.url` as an in-scope URL
- `initialize()`is called
    - It registers a new Suite tab
    - Registers an extension name, which overwrites the `registerExtenderCallbacks()` name
    - Checks whether `http://test.url` is in scope, and writes an alert to the Dashboard
- The new Suite tab contains a button
    - When the button is used, the filename according to both the old API and Montoya API are printed to the output
